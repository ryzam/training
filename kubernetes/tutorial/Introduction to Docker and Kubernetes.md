**Introduction to Docker and Kubernetes**

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Containers and Docker
### 1.1 What are Containers?
- **Definition and Benefits of Containers:**
  - Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, such as code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and dependencies.
  - Benefits include portability, consistency across environments, resource efficiency, faster deployment, and better scalability compared to traditional virtual machines.
  
- **Differences between Containers and Virtual Machines:**
  - Virtual Machines (VMs) include a full OS and virtualized hardware, leading to higher resource consumption.
  - Containers share the host OS kernel and isolate applications in a lightweight manner, making them more efficient and faster.

### 1.2 Introduction to Docker
- **Overview of Docker and Its Importance:**
  - Docker is a platform that enables developers to build, ship, and run applications inside containers.
  - It simplifies application deployment by eliminating inconsistencies across different environments.
  
- **How Docker Works:**
  - Docker utilizes containerization technology to package applications and their dependencies.
  - It runs applications in isolated environments, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production.
  
- **Docker Architecture:**
  - **Docker Engine:** The runtime responsible for running and managing containers.
  - **Images:** Pre-packaged application environments that can be instantiated as containers.
  - **Containers:** Running instances of Docker images.
  - **Registry:** A repository for storing and sharing container images (e.g., Docker Hub, private registries).

### 1.3 Installing Docker
- **Installing Docker on Windows, macOS, and Linux:**
  - Windows:
    - Install Docker Desktop from the official Docker website.
    - Enable WSL 2 backend for better performance.
  - macOS:
    - Install Docker Desktop from Docker's official website.
  - Linux:
    - Install Docker using package managers (`apt`, `yum`, or `dnf`).
    - Add the user to the Docker group to run Docker commands without `sudo`.

- **Verifying Installation:**
  - Run `docker version` to check the installed version.
  - Run `docker run hello-world` to verify that Docker is working correctly.

### 1.4 Basic Docker Commands
- **Managing Images and Containers:**
  - `docker pull <image>` - Download images from Docker Hub.
  - `docker run -d --name mycontainer <image>` - Run a container in detached mode.
  - `docker ps` - List running containers.
  - `docker stop <container_id>` - Stop a running container.
  - `docker rm <container_id>` - Remove a container.
  - `docker rmi <image_id>` - Remove an image.
  - `docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh` - Execute commands in a running container.
  - `docker logs <container_id>` - View logs of a container.

### 1.5 Creating and Managing Docker Images
- **Writing a Dockerfile:**
  - Define the base image (e.g., `FROM ubuntu:latest`).
  - Install dependencies using `RUN`.
  - Set environment variables using `ENV`.
  - Copy application files using `COPY` or `ADD`.
  - Define the entry point using `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`.
  
- **Building an Image:**
  - Run `docker build -t myimage .` to create an image from a Dockerfile.
  
- **Tagging and Pushing an Image to Docker Hub:**
  - Tag an image: `docker tag myimage myrepo/myimage:v1`
  - Push the image: `docker push myrepo/myimage:v1`

### 1.6 Docker Networking
- **Types of Docker Networks:**
  - **Bridge Network:** Default network type for containers.
  - **Host Network:** Direct access to the hostâ€™s network.
  - **Overlay Network:** Used in multi-host Docker deployments.

- **Creating and Managing Docker Networks:**
  - `docker network create mynetwork`
  - `docker network ls` - List available networks.
  - `docker network connect mynetwork mycontainer`

### 1.7 Docker Compose
- **Introduction to Docker Compose:**
  - Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using `docker-compose.yml`.

- **Writing a `docker-compose.yml` File:**
  ```yaml
  version: '3'
  services:
    web:
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - "80:80"
  ```
  
- **Running Multiple Containers:**
  - `docker-compose up -d` to start services.
  - `docker-compose down` to stop and remove services.

## Chapter 2: Introduction to Kubernetes
### 2.1 What is Kubernetes?
- **Overview:**
  - Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

- **Benefits of Using Kubernetes:**
  - Automated scaling and self-healing.
  - Efficient resource utilization.
  - Declarative configuration using YAML manifests.

### 2.2 Kubernetes Architecture
- **Master Node and Worker Nodes:**
  - Master node manages cluster operations.
  - Worker nodes run containerized applications.

- **Components of Kubernetes:**
  - **API Server:** Handles requests.
  - **Controller Manager:** Maintains desired state.
  - **Scheduler:** Assigns pods to nodes.
  - **Kubelet:** Manages node and pods.
  - **Kube Proxy:** Handles networking.

### 2.3 Installing Kubernetes
- **Installing Minikube for Local Setup:**
  - Install Minikube.
  - Start Minikube: `minikube start`.

- **Installing `kubectl` (Kubernetes CLI):**
  - Install using package manager.
  - Verify installation: `kubectl version`.

### 2.4 Basic Kubernetes Commands
- **Managing Resources:**
  - `kubectl get pods` - List running pods.
  - `kubectl create -f deployment.yml` - Deploy applications.
  - `kubectl delete -f deployment.yml` - Remove applications.

### 2.5 Deploying Applications on Kubernetes
- **Writing a Kubernetes YAML Manifest:**
  - Define deployments, services, and ingress rules.
  
- **Scaling Applications:**
  - `kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=3`

### 2.6 Kubernetes Networking, Storage, and Monitoring**
- **Pod-to-Pod Communication:**
  - Service types: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer.

- **Persistent Volumes & ConfigMaps:**
  - Using persistent storage in Kubernetes.

- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Prometheus and Grafana setup.
